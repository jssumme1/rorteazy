# Images for CEERS field

The images are too large to put on GitHub, but there is a curl file to fetch the files from MAST.

How to download the files:

    cd /path/to/sorteazy/CEERS_EGS1/images
    chmod +x MAST_2022-12-05T1423.sh
    ./MAST_2022-12-05T1423.sh
    
You will then have to move the files out of their respective directories and into a common directory, such as /sorteazy/CEERS_EGS1/images.
